# my-developer-path
Here is a basic path example that I would have used if I were starting to program again in 2024.

Well, you want to enter the web development world, but you're not familiar with it. However, you are familiar with technology, [what programming is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIRGjwYgdT4), and have a specific goal in mind. So, let's start making it happen!

## First Steps
First, you have to know how web pages are made of, to start going deep into it, let's check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzyfIiVZPJA).
Yeah, i know, pretty basic for you, know let's see what is on server and [how to deploy your first web page](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQP89ish9t8). Yeah sure, you want more about code, but it will come after.

### Some concepts that are nice to have
* What is a [CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/cli/)?
* How to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs)
* How [do i run my js code](https://www.programiz.com/javascript/get-started)?
  
### Where do i code?
well, you saw it in the last video, but if not, download you development envairoment [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) .

### HTML
*HTML is like the skeleton of a webpage. It's what gives your webpage structure, just like bones give structure to your body. Think of it as the blueprint that tells your browser where everything should go—headings, paragraphs, images, and all that jazz.*

To this point you'll be familiar with what HTML is, but maybe you want to know more, my recomendation is just look what you need from HTML in the moment you need it, but if you want to profundizise, see [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JDsVQBr3bA&list=PLVzwufPir354ULCAd1bR6rotNBYaZiRzM)

### CSS
*CSS is like the fashion stylist for your webpage. It decides how your webpage should look and feel. It's the magic that adds color, spacing, fonts, and makes everything look snazzy. Without CSS, your webpage might look like it's stuck in the '90s—plain and outdated.*

Well, know, let's go ahead and make your own HTML, use you knowledge and make a basic webpage with only HTML you can create a folder, and add to it a file with name index.html and another with name styles.css
once you have your files, let's combine the files and get creative: 
look how to add you css to your html file [here](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_howto.asp).
some bases for css [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PnVor36_40).
know what the hell is [flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox)?
and now let's practice some flexbox: https://flexboxfroggy.com/#es

### Responsive?
well, know you can create basic HTML, add some styling, aling your objects, now you need to know [responsive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNSX21dh6kw), just a little bit so cheeck [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU7jJ3NbPdA)

## JavaScript
*JavaScript is the little wizard that brings your webpage to life. It's like the conductor of an orchestra, making things move, dance, and interact with your visitors. From cool animations to dynamic forms, JavaScript is the secret sauce that turns your static webpage into an interactive playground.*

Here, you will need to make a stand, take a breath, and be prepared, cause you will be here a lot of hours, this is the principal part of web development, we will be traveling for all important topics in JS, and try to learn all necesary to grow up to a real world tool, but everything on time, let's go with JS.

### Basics
From the begginig, you alredy know what JS is, let's [learn how to use it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6NZfCO5SIk)

*Imagine you're building a castle with different types of bricks (data structures) to create its structure. Algorithms are like the blueprints guiding your construction, telling you how to efficiently build and organize. Logic is your sharp sword, helping you reason through challenges.*

*Together, they're the magic trio that turns raw data into powerful solutions. Master them, and you'll conquer digital realms with elegance and efficiency!*, take your time and see this course [i recomend to you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coqQwbDezUA&list=PLC3y8-rFHvwjPxNAKvZpdnsr41E0fCMMP)

### Paradigms

Well, let's get heavy, in order to have the concepts needed to understand the most importants parts of js, you will need to know [what a paradigm is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1p5OlO5tWg). Ans now knowing this, you will prefer to learn functional programming and [object oriented programming(OOP)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R5R0sNFFps), OOP is kinda easier to understand first. before going a little bit deep, don't get confused what is a class? what is a object? see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AWRivBk0Gw). You have the needed concept so i'll give you [this link](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=object+oriented+programming+in+js) and this [other one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZphE5HcQPQ).

The functions are probably the most importat kind of object you will need to know in javascript, so learn how functional programming works in this language is a must, [but why?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsVL_xrYO0w) so i'll recomend to you to see [this short list of videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMUiFMZr7vk&list=PL0zVEGEvSaeEd9hlmCXrk5yUyqUag-n84) 

if you saw something called TypeScript, don't be afraid and don't pay many attention to it yet.

### Concepts
Know, for the nex steps you will need to have in mind and clear some concepts, i guess this part is better if you read, i'll give you the list:
* What is a [DataBase(DB)](https://www.oracle.com/in/database/what-is-database/).
* What is a [library](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/web-development/programming-library-guide/).
* What is [http protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview)?
* What is an [API](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/api/?nc1=h_ls)?
* How can i consume an API and [get data simply with JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)?
* What is [axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)?

### Promises

Whit all this in mind, let's focuse on [promises](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li7FzDHYZpc), that's only the begginig, know maybe you want to see more code about [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHvZLI7Db8E) or see more about how promises [can be chained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHLw0LDXdos) or just more about [promises methods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQtgi8uElmk). However have in mind that promises have a lot of methos, and maybe you'll want to know his use cases, so [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) is more documentation for you to read.

## Practice

After all this journey you have a lot of knowledge there, but you will need to make and read code, so take your time and practice all this concepts [here](https://leetcode.com/) make an account, and be brave, try solve some of the easier ones.
