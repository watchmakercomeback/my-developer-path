# my-developer-path
Here is a basic path example that I would have used if I were starting to program again in 2024.

Well, you want to enter the web development world, but you're not familiar with it. However, you are familiar with technology, [what programming is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIRGjwYgdT4), and have a specific goal in mind. So, let's start making it happen!

## First Steps
First, you have to know how web pages are made of, to start going deep into it, o let's check out this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzyfIiVZPJA
Yeah, i know, pretty basic for you, know let's see what on server and how to deploy your first web page, i know, you want more about code, but will come after: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQP89ish9t8

### Where do i code?
well, you see it in the last video, but if not, download you development envairoment [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) .

### HTML
*HTML is like the skeleton of a webpage. It's what gives your webpage structure, just like bones give structure to your body. Think of it as the blueprint that tells your browser where everything should go—headings, paragraphs, images, and all that jazz.*

To this point you'll be familiar with what HTML is, but maybe you want to know more, my recomendation is just look what you need from HTML in the moment you need it, but if you want to profundizise, see this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JDsVQBr3bA&list=PLVzwufPir354ULCAd1bR6rotNBYaZiRzM

### CSS
*CSS is like the fashion stylist for your webpage. It decides how your webpage should look and feel. It's the magic that adds color, spacing, fonts, and makes everything look snazzy. Without CSS, your webpage might look like it's stuck in the '90s—plain and outdated.*

Well, know, let's go ahead and make your own HTML, use you knowledge and make a basic webpage with only HTML you can create a folder, and add to it a file with name index.html and another with name styles.css
once you have your files, let's combine the files and get creative: 
look how to add you css to your html file [here](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_howto.asp).
some bases for css [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PnVor36_40).
know what the hell is [flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox)?
and now let's practice some flexbox: https://flexboxfroggy.com/#es

### Responsive?
well, know you can create basic HTML, add some styling, aling your objects, know you need to know [responsive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNSX21dh6kw), just a little bit so cheeck [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU7jJ3NbPdA)

## JavaScript
*JavaScript is the little wizard that brings your webpage to life. It's like the conductor of an orchestra, making things move, dance, and interact with your visitors. From cool animations to dynamic forms, JavaScript is the secret sauce that turns your static webpage into an interactive playground.*

Here, you will need to make a stand, take a breath, and be prepared, cause you will be here a lot of hours, this is the principal part of web development, we will be traveling for all important topics in JS, and try to learn all necesary to grow up to a real world tool, but everything on time, let's go with JS.

### Basics
From the begginig, you alredy know what JS is,let's [learn how to use it] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6NZfCO5SIk)

*Imagine you're building a castle with different types of bricks (data structures) to create its structure. Algorithms are like the blueprints guiding your construction, telling you how to efficiently build and organize. Logic is your sharp sword, helping you reason through challenges.*

*Together, they're the magic trio that turns raw data into powerful solutions. Master them, and you'll conquer digital realms with elegance and efficiency!*, take your time and see this course [i recomend to you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coqQwbDezUA&list=PLC3y8-rFHvwjPxNAKvZpdnsr41E0fCMMP)
